# GitHub CLI

`gh` is GitHub on the command line. It brings pull requests, issues, and other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working with `git` and your code.

For more information please visit [https://cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com).

## Installation

As soon as this port gets imported to OpenBSD, you'll be able to install it with `pkg_add`:

```shell
$ doas pkg_add gh
gh-1.0.0: ok
Read shared items: ok
```

## Thanks

* [All `gh` contributors](https://github.com/cli/cli/graphs/contributors) for developing the software in the first place
